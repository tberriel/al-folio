I am working with Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j_sMzokAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao">Javier Civera</a> on Computer Vision and Representation Learning for World Models. We aim to disentangle the properties of the elements on a scene to improve the generalization capabilities of current semantic SLAM algorithms. Currently I am diving in the multi-scene neural rendering world.

I have special interest on the human brain and how it works and develops abstract representations and thoughts.

Professional learner, passionate about discovering and understanding the wonders of this complex world. I enjoy meeting new cultures and their richness.

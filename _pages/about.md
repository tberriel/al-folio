I am working with Dr. Javier Civera on Computer Vision and Representation Learning for World Models. We aim to disentangle the properties of the elements on a scene to improve the generalization capabilities of current semantic SLAM algorithms. 

I have special interest on the human brain and how it works and develops abstract representations and thoughts.

Professional learner, passionate about discovering and understanding the wonders of this complex world. I enjoy meeting new cultures and their richness.

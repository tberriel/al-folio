In the course 2022 - 2023, I will help Javier Civera, J. M. Montiel and J. Bermudez in the laboratory sessions of `Machine Learning` and `Computer Vision` of the <a href="https://eina.unizar.es/MRGCV">MRGCV</a>, and `Computer Vision` of the  `BSc in Electronics and Automatic Control Engineering`.  I'm eager to collaborate and learn from such expert and dedicated faculties!

As last year, in the course 2023 - 2024, I will help Javier Civera, J. M. Montiel, J. Bermudez and J. D. Tardos in the laboratory sessions of `Machine Learning` and `Computer Vision` of the <a href="https://eina.unizar.es/MRGCV">MRGCV</a>, and `Aprendizaje autom√°tico` of the `BSc in Informatics Engineering`.  I am eager to continue collaborating and learning from such expert and dedicated faculties!

    - title: Predoctoral researcher
      institution: University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain
      year: 2022 - 
      description:
        - I am working on the application of Computer Vision and Representation Learning algorithms for Spatial AI.

    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain
      year: 2020 - 2022
      description:
        - Worked with Javier Civera on the use of Bayesian Neural Networks for uncertainty prediction in 360º images' layout estimation. 

    - title: Robotics Research & Development junior Engineer
      institution: ITAINNOVA, Zaragoza, Spain
      year: 2019 - 2020
      description:
        - I was part of the Mecatronic division, a multidisciplinary team which developed solutions for autonomous systems. I helped developing and integrating software for different autonomous tasks, including deploying perception algorithms to detect and avoid dynamic obstacles, and integrating GPS information into the localization estimation. I also worked on writing documentation, and acting as support for the client.
        - As my first working experience I was lucky to be sourrounded by experienced and knowledgeble engineers. I learned the importance of project development and tracking, testing, documentation, and overall, appropriate communication skills and team dynamics.

    - title: Master in Robotics, Graphics, and Computer Vision (MRGCV)
      institution: University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain
      year: 2020 - 2022
      description:
        - Multidisciplinary master which covered light transimissions and scene renderings, multiview geometry, autonomous robots navigation and planning, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, and also computer architectures. It has been a pleasure to learn from renown experts from the Robotics Pereception and Real Time Group, the Graphics and Imaging Lab, and the Computer Architecture Group.
        - My master's thesis, 'Learning disentangled representations of scenes from images', studied the use of transfer learning as bias to reduce the computational cost of a State of the Art model for unsupervised semantic disentanglement learning of 2D synthetic scenes.
    - title: Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Automatic Control Engineering
      institution: University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain
      year: 2015 - 2019
      description:
        - With a great importance to both digital and analogic electronic devices, and engineering control theory, the bachelor also covered other industrial fields like fluid dynamics, mechanics, and thermodynamcis and heat transmission. On the last year I took specialization courses on Autonomous Robots and Computer Vision.
        - My bachelor's thesis, 'Automated human actions recognition in 3D video sequences', focused on the study of Long Short Term Memory neural networks for classification of RGB-D sequences of human actions.
